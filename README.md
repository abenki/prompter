# Prompter

Prompter is a web app intended to provide a simple way to use recurrent prompts. For example, if I often need to translate code from a language to another, I could save a template prompt and reuse it so that I don't have to constantly type all the instructions. This project is the occasion for me to familiarize myself with using LLM APIs from different projects, and use Reflex to develop a web app using Python.
